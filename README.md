## API Documentation

Access the API documentation via Swagger UI:

- **Swagger UI:** [http://localhost:8080/api-docs](http://localhost:8080/api-docs)

## Usage

### API Endpoints

Refer to the [API Documentation](#api-documentation) for detailed information on available endpoints.

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"incidentKey": "12345"}'
```

## Configuration

Configuration is crucial for the application to run successfully. Ensure all necessary settings are configured in `application.yml`.

### Key Configuration Parameters

- **Server Port:**

  ```yaml
  server:
    port: 8080
  ```
- **Database Settings:**

  ```yaml
  spring:
    datasource:
      url: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database
      username: your_db_username
      password: your_db_password
  ```
- **External Service URLs:**

  ```yaml
  integration:
    messaging:
      url: http://messaging.url
      channel: the-channel
      token: the-token
    pob:
      url: http://pob.url
      apiKey: some-key
    jira:
      password: some-password
      username: some-username
      url: http://jira.url
      projectKey: PROJECT-KEY
  spring:
    security:
      oauth2:
        client:
          provider:
            messaging:
              token-uri: http://token.url
          registration:
            messaging:
              client-id: the-client-id
              client-secret: the-client-secret
  ```

### Database Initialization

The project is set up with [Flyway](https://github.com/flyway/flyway) for database migrations. Flyway is disabled by default so you will have to enable it to automatically populate the database schema upon application startup.

```yaml
spring:
  flyway:
    enabled: true
```

- **No additional setup is required** for database initialization, as long as the database connection settings are correctly configured.

### Additional Notes

- **Application Profiles:**

  Use Spring profiles (`dev`, `prod`, etc.) to manage different configurations for different environments.

- **Logging Configuration:**

  Adjust logging levels if necessary.
